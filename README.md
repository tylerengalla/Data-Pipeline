## 📌 **Project Overview**  
In this capstone project, I built an **end-to-end data pipeline** leveraging **Databricks, Azure Data Lake, and Snowflake** to process and analyze data. This project consisted of:
✅ Uploading files to **Databricks File System (DBFS)**  
✅ Building **ETL pipelines** to move data from **DBFS → Azure Data Lake → Snowflake**  
✅ Implementing **Medallion Architecture** (Raw, Silver, and Gold layers)  
✅ Using **Snowpark in Jupyter Notebook** for analytical computations  
✅ Performing **data analysis** on the **120 Years of Olympic History dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results)
