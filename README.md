# Data-Pipeline
Capstone Project: Building a Data Pipeline with Databricks, Azure, and Snowflake

In this capstone project, I built an end-to-end data pipeline using Databricks, Azure Data Lake, and Snowflake. The project involved uploading files to DBFS, creating data pipelines to move data into an Azure Data Lake, and implementing a Medallion architecture with Raw, Silver, and Gold layers in Snowflake. I also leveraged Snowpark in a Jupyter Notebook to perform analytical computations on the dataset.  

For the analysis, I explored the 120 Years of Olympic History dataset from Kaggle, uncovering trends and insights about athletes and results over time.

Watch as I demonstrate the full data engineering workflow, from ingestion to analysis.
